The fifth task of prodigy - Network packet analyzer
Network packet sniffer is a tool developed in Python using the Scapy library. It prompts the user to start before initiating packet capture. Once accepted, the tool begins sniffing network packets, getting information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and payload data. It presents this information in the console with TCP payloads displayed in RED, UDP payloads in CYAN, and ICMP payloads in BLUE. The captured data is appended to a log file named packet_log.txt.
